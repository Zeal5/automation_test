TASK 1:
    Write a script that uses the built-in method `get_next_action` and returns only the Next-Step from `RegisteredActions`.

Steps to run:

    In `main.py`, set the task variable to desired action.
    
    `previous_steps` is the action performed in the last step.
    
    `outcome_was` is the outcome of the last step.

The script returns `AgentOutput` as a dictionary (all possible `RegisteredActions` that can be taken for the next action).

`P.S.:` You need to update the content of `webPage.html` if you want to interact with another webpage.

TASK 2:
    Show the input and output in dictionary format for the get_next_action method.
